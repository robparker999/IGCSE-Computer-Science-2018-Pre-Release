Task
A farmer records the milk production of a herd of cows. Every cow has a unique 3-digit identity code. Each cow can be milked twice a day, seven days a week. The volume of milk from each cow is recorded in litres correct to one decimal place (yield) every time the cow is milked. The size of the herd is fixed. At the end of the week the total and the average yield for each cow for that week is calculated.

The farmer identifies the cow that has produced the most milk that week. The farmer also identifies any cows that have produced less than 12 litres of milk on four or more days that week.

A program is required to record the yield for each cow every time it is milked, calculate the total weekly volume of milk for the herd and the average yield per cow in a week. The program must also identify the cow with the best yield that week and identify any cows with a yield of less than 12 litres of milk for four or more days that week.

Write and test a program or programs for the farmer.
• Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data.
• Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.
• All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested. 

TASK 1 – Record the yield.
Write a program for TASK 1 to record the milk yields for a week. The program records and stores the identity code number and the yield every time a cow is milked.

TASK 2 – Calculate the statistics.
Using your recorded data from TASK 1, calculate and display the total weekly volume of milk for the herd to the nearest whole litre. Calculate and display the average yield per cow in a week to the nearest whole litre.

TASK 3 – Identify the most productive cow and cows that are producing a low volume of milk.
Extend TASK 2 to identify and display the identity code number and weekly yield of the cow that has produced the most milk. Also identify and display the identity code numbers of any cows with a yield of less than 12 litres of milk for four days or more in the week.
